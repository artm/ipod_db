    description <<-__
    Update the iPod database. Given directories of bookmarkable and non-bookmarkable
    media '#{program}' will find all supported tracks add them to the iPod database so
    the device is aware of their existance.

    The tracks under 'books' folder will get "riffled" - tracks from the same folder
    are spread out in the list so they don't follow each other if possible. IN THE
    FUTURE it is planned to allow configuring of track groups which are treated like
    single folders - e.g. to spread out all SciAm's "60 second somthing" podcasts along
    the playlist.

    It is perfectly possible to have other directories full of tracks in device's
    subconscious - e.g. when time-sharing the device among members of a poor
    family. Just make sure you update the database using your directories when
    receiving it from a relation.

    iPod remembers playback position on bookmarkable media and the '#{program}' goes
    out of its way to preserve the bookmarks. It also removes bookmarkable files
    from shuffle list.

    I configure gpodder to place podcast files inside IPOD/books directory and delete
    them after syncing. Having copied podcasts I run 'ipod sync' to update the
    database on the device and it's ready for consumption.
