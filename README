NAME
  sync-ipod.rb v0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
  sync-ipod.rb ipod_root [options]+

DESCRIPTION
  Update iPod Shuffle (2nd gen) database. Given directories of bookmarkable
  and non-bookmarkable media sync-ipod.rb will find all supported tracks and
  add them to the iPod database so the device is aware of their existance.

  It is perfectly possible to have other directories full of tracks in device's
  subconscious - e.g. when time-sharing the device among members of a poor
  family. Just make sure you update the database using your directories when
  receiving it from a relation.

  iPod remembers playback position on bookmarkable media and the sync-ipod.rb goes
  out of its way to preserve the bookmarks. It also removes bookmarkable files
  from shuffle list.

PARAMETERS
  ipod_root (1 -> ipod_root=/media/artm/IPOD)
      path where ipod is mounted
  --books=books, -b (0 ~> books=books)
      subdirectory of ipod with bookmarkable media
  --songs=songs, -s (0 ~> songs=songs)
      subdirectory of ipod with non-bookmarkable media
  --help, -h

HISTORY
  I used to do the same sort of thing and more with a bunch of python scripts.
  My cheapo mass-storage mp3 player has died recently and my son has donated
  (voluntarily) his Shuffle to me, but python scripts were all bit-rot and
  refused to work and I haven't touched python for several years already, so
  I rewrote the main script in ruby. The reading part of python version still
  worked so I made it dump what it read in ruby-esque format for testing
  (that's test_data.rb). The test_data isn't very exciting though (all
  tracks are in default state without bookmarks).
