NAME
  sync-ipod.rb v0.1.0

SYNOPSIS
  sync-ipod.rb ipod_root [options]+

DESCRIPTION
  Update iPod Shuffle (2nd gen) database. Given directories of bookmarkable
  and non-bookmarkable media sync-ipod.rb will find all supported tracks and
  add them to the iPod database so the device is aware of their existance.
  
  It is perfectly possible to have other directories full of tracks in device's
  subconscious - e.g. when time-sharing the device among members of a poor
  family. Just make sure you update the database using your directories when
  receiving it from a relation.
  
  iPod remembers playback position on bookmarkable media and the sync-ipod.rb goes
  out of its way to preserve the bookmarks. It also removes bookmarkable files
  from shuffle list.
